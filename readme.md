# Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis with R

This workshop provides a brief introduction to Bayesian methods, both theoretically and practically. 
It introduces some of the fundamental concepts of Bayesian inference and Bayesian modelling, including how Bayesian methods differ from their classical statistics counterparts.
It then introduces how to do Bayesian modelling in R using the [brms](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/) package, which is built on top of the powerful [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) language for MCMC based Bayesian inference.
